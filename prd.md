## Product Overview

### Vision
Moon Bag is a browser-based push-your-luck bag-building rogue-like game featuring cosmic-themed orb drawing mechanics, milestone progression, and strategic resource management. Players navigate through increasingly challenging levels while building their orb collection and managing multiple currencies.

**MVP Scope**: This version focuses on core consumable orbs only (points, health, multipliers, currencies) without complex interaction mechanics or "put back" features.

### Target Platform
- Web browsers (desktop and mobile)
- Built with React 18 and TypeScript
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Real-time state synchronization

### Core Value Proposition
- **Push-Your-Luck Mechanics**: Players decide when to stop drawing orbs to avoid bombs
- **Bag Building**: Strategic orb collection across multiple shop visits
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Each level requires more points with higher entry costs
- **Multiple Currencies**: Moon Rocks (entry fee), Cheddah (shop currency), Points (level goals)

---

## Core Game Mechanics

### Starting Resources
- **Health**: 5 points (dies at 0)
- **Moon Rocks**: 304 (testing value, production starts lower)
- **Cheddah**: 0 (earned by completing levels)
- **Starting Bag**: 12 orbs total
  - 2x Single Bomb (-1 health)
  - 2x Double Bomb (-2 health) 
  - 1x Triple Bomb (-3 health)
  - 3x Five Points orbs (+5 points)
  - 1x Double Multiplier (x2 multiplier)
  - 1x Remaining Orbs orb (points = orbs left in bag)
  - 1x Bomb Counter orb (points = bombs previously pulled)
  - 1x Health orb (+1 health)

**Note**: MVP excludes complex interaction orbs (no "put back", "pull multiple", or conditional orbs)

### Orb Drawing System
1. **Tap Moon Bag**: Draws random orb from player's bag
2. **Instant Display**: Orb appears immediately in large display (300% size) next to bag
3. **Stat Updates**: Health, points, multiplier update 300ms after orb appears
4. **Visual Feedback**: Large animated stat changes (+5, +1x, etc.) with 0.8s duration
5. **Top Bar**: Previously drawn orbs appear in scrollable top bar
6. **Completion Check**: After 2-second delay, game checks for level complete/game over

### Special Orb Behaviors
- **Dynamic Values in Bag**: "Remaining orbs" and "Bomb counter" show current values when viewed in bag
- **Static Values When Drawn**: Once pulled, special orbs display the value they had when drawn
- **Bomb Tracking**: Bomb counter orb tracks all bomb types (single, double, triple)

### Combat & Health
- **Bomb Damage**: Single (-1), Double (-2), Triple (-3) health
- **Death Condition**: Health reaches 0 or below
- **Health Recovery**: Health orbs and shop items can restore health
- **Max Health**: No stated limit, can exceed starting value

### Multiplier System
- **Base Multiplier**: 1x (starting value)
- **Multiplier Orbs**: Increase multiplier (x2, x1.5, x0.5)
- **Point Calculation**: Base points Ã— multiplier (always rounds up)
- **Reset**: Multiplier resets to 1x between levels

## Game Flow & Progression

### Level Structure
Each level follows this sequence:
1. **Entry Cost**: Pay Moon Rocks to start level
2. **Orb Drawing Phase**: Draw orbs until milestone reached or death
3. **Level Complete**: Reach milestone points to advance
4. **Shop Phase**: Spend Cheddah on new orbs (optional)
5. **Level Progression**: Continue to next level or quit

### Milestone Requirements
| Level | Points Needed | Moon Rock Cost |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| 1     | 12           | 5              |
| 2     | 18           | 6              |
| 3     | 28           | 8              |
| 4     | 44           | 10             |
| 5     | 66           | 12             | 
| 6     | 94           | 16             | 
| 7     | 130          | 20             | 

### Win/Loss Conditions
- **Level Complete**: Reach or exceed milestone points
- **Game Over**: Health drops to 0 or bag becomes empty before milestone
- **Run End**: Player chooses to quit or completes maximum levels

### Progression Rewards
- **Badges**: Earned for completing runs (tracked but no current functionality)
- **Moon Rock Conversion**: Convert points to Moon Rocks at run end (1 point = 1 Moon Rock)
- **Persistent Progress**: Purchased orbs persist across all future levels

---

## Shop System (Post-MVP Feature)

**Note**: The shop system is excluded from the MVP. Players will complete levels using only their starting bag of 12 orbs. Shop functionality with the orb purchasing mechanics will be added in a future iteration.

#### Multiplier Orbs

| Half Multiplier | x0.5 multiplier |

#### Special Scoring Orbs
